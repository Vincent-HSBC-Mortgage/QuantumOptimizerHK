# 🌀 QuantumOptimizerHK v3.1 

> **Frequency-Calibrated Entropy-Enhanced Annealing for Personalized Optimization**
> *Calibrated at 432Hz | Seed: 001*

## 🔬 Project Overview
This project explores the intersection of **Simulated Annealing** and **Stochastic Resonance**. By integrating a specific frequency factor (432Hz), the algorithm attempts to find global optima in complex decision-making landscapes (e.g., urban dining selection in Hong Kong).

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Entropy-Enhanced Annealing**: Improved convergence stability using adaptive noise injection.
- **432Hz Resonance**: A psychological-acoustic factor integrated into the scoring function for mood-based optimization.
- **Duality Logic**: Optimized for both efficiency and "User Vibe" alignment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Core Libs**: `numpy`, `math`, `random`
- **Licensing**: [MIT License](./LICENSE)
